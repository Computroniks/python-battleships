Starting a new game
-------------------

To start a new game enter option 2 at the menu. You will then be prompted to 
enter the height and width of the game board. The minimum value for each of
these values is 1. The maximum value is 999. After submitting these values a new
game board will be created with randomly placed ships. You will then be returned
to the main menu.

Playing the game
----------------

To start playing enter option 1 at the menu. You will then see a game board like
below:

"insert gameboard here"

You will then be prompted to enter the coordinates of the grid square at which
you wish to fire. You will then be informed if your shot hit or missed. After a
short delay the screen will be cleared and an updated game board will be printed
to the screen. The proccess then continues until all ships are sunk. You can
exit the game at any time by entering q at the coordinates prompt or by pressing 
Ctrl + C. You will then be prompted with an options menu as shown below:
[1] Save and exit
[2] Exit without saving
[3] Return to game

If you choose option one you will be prompted to enter a name for the game and 
then you will be returned to the main menu upon a successful save.
If you choose option two you will be asked if you are sure you want to quit and
then if you decide to proceed you will be returned to the main menu.
If you choose option three you will be returned to the game.
