All contributions (including pull requests) must agree to the Developer
Certificate of Origin (DCO) version 1.1. This is exactly the same one created
and used by the Linux kernel developers and posted on [http://developercertificate.org/](http://developercertificate.org/).
A copy of this can also be found in the project root or by writing to 
[mnickson@sidingsmedia.com](mailto:mnickson@sidingsmedia.com).
This is a developer's certification that he or she has the right to submit the 
patch for inclusion into the project. Simply submitting a contribution implies
this agreement, however, please include a "Signed-off-by" tag in every patch 
(this tag is a conventional way to confirm that you agree to the DCO).
